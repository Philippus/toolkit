# The Scala Toolkit
The batteries-included Scala. Read about the Scala Toolkit in [Scala Toolkit makes Scala powerful straight out of the box](https://virtuslab.com/blog/scala-toolkit-makes-scala-powerful-straight-out-of-the-box/).

## Using the Scala Toolkit

The Scala Toolkit is currently in pre-release stage. However, you can already use it from [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/):
```scala
//> using toolkit "latest"
```
Or by including the latest Toolkit artifact in your build file: `org.scala-lang::toolkit:0.1.6`
